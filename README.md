It has the following parameters

### Empty State Component
The empty state component provides a styled screen to show the user when no content is available to be shown. 
As a reference for your decision when to use this screen take a look at the respective [design guidline](https://material.io/design/communication/empty-states.html#content).
The following parameters are available
- **header** The header shown on the page
- **message** The messaage shown on the page
- **icon** The icon shown on the page. We recommend the `rocket_launch` icon for screens that get active if the user does something and the `bedtime` icon for screnns that are inactive if everything is in order. For more icons take a look [here](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons&icon.set=Material+Symbols)
``` html
<empty-state [header]="'Nothing to show'" [message]="'We canÂ´t show you anything here.'" icon="bedtime"></empty-state>
```
